== Current State: Project Skeleton

The repository currently contains only infrastructure:

* [x] Multi-forge mirror workflow (GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket)
* [x] Instant-sync propagation workflow
* [x] AI assistant configuration (CLAUDE.md)
* [ ] Plugin implementation
* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] Tests

== Roadmap

=== Phase 0: Specification (Current)

* [ ] Define what security tools/versions the plugin will manage
* [ ] Document target use cases
* [ ] Establish plugin architecture

=== Phase 1: Core Plugin

* [ ] Implement asdf plugin interface scripts:
** `bin/list-all` - list available versions
** `bin/download` - download specific version
** `bin/install` - install specific version
* [ ] Add version verification (checksums, signatures)
* [ ] Basic documentation

=== Phase 2: Security Hardening

* [ ] GPG signature verification for downloads
* [ ] SHA256 checksum validation
* [ ] Supply chain security documentation
* [ ] Reproducible builds support

=== Phase 3: Extended Features

* [ ] Multiple security tool support
* [ ] Platform detection and binary selection
* [ ] Integration with Guix/Nix for hermetic installs

_Detailed milestones will be added once project specification is complete._
